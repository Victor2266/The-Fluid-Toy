## üöÄ Key Features  

### üßä Collision Systems  
- **Box Colliders**: Combine multiple oriented boxes to create complex shapes (e.g., pinwheels)  
- **Hybrid Circle Colliders**:  
  - Small colliders: GPU-accelerated using spatial hashing grids  
  - Large colliders: CPU-managed to prevent GPU performance degradation  
- **Dynamic Colliders**:  
  - Texture-based density maps for complex shapes  
  - Runtime-alterable collider geometry via alpha threshold sampling  
  - Player-editable collider deformation through brush tools  

### ‚ö° Dynamic Particle Management  
- **Activation/Deactivation**:  
  - Particle structs with enable flags for conditional processing  
  - Memory-optimized allocation using pre-allocated buffers
  - Draw Brush which uses interlocked add operation to avoid race condition
  - Eraser Brush which randomizes particle position for even density distribution
  - **Source/Drain Objects**:  
  - Source: Spawns particles with configurable initial velocities  
  - Drain: Disables particles using spatial triggers  
  - Automatic buffer management with particle recycling
- **Multi-Fluid Support**:  
  - Data-oriented design with fluid property tables  
  - 64px√ó1px gradient textures per fluid type stitched into 2D atlas  
  - Shader-driven visual differentiation using dynamic branching
